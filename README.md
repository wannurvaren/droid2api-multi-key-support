## üîë Key Features

The droid2api-multi-key-support provides several important features:

### **Multi-API Key Support**

- **Key Pooling:** Add multiple API keys to your setup.
- **Semicolon Separation:** Separate keys in the environment variable with a semicolon `;`.
- **File Configuration:** Store keys in a `factory_keys.txt` file, with one key per line.
- **Polling Methods:** Choose between weighted polling based on health or simple sequential polling.
- **Smart Selection:** The system automatically selects keys based on historical success rates.

### **Automatic Key Management**
